# Minseg-Robot-Balancing
Balancing the robot by feeding back the states (angular position, angular velocity, linear position and linear velocity).

•	Made a self-balancing robot using Minseg and Arduino board. 
•	Measuring the real-time states and feeding back (state feedback method) with the help of accelerometer, gyroscope and encoder. (storing data in Realterm/coolterm)
•	Making use of MATLAB and Simulink and working on derived mathematical model for Minseg Robot and analyzing its controllability, observability and stability. 
•	Designed a mathematical model for feedback controller and observer and verified them with Simulink model.
•	Precisely controlling the gain for angular position and angular velocity for balancing the robot.
