# Minseg-Robot-Balancing
Balancing the robot by feeding back the states (angular position, angular velocity, linear position and linear velocity).

•	Made a self-balancing robot using Minseg and Arduino board. 

•	Measuring the real-time states with the help of accelerometer, gyroscope and encoder and feeding them back to the system (state feedback controller method). (Realterm/coolterm are used to store data for long period).

•	Making use of MATLAB and Simulink and working on derived mathematical model for Minseg Robot and analyzing its controllability, observability and stability. 

•	Designed a mathematical model for feedback controller and observer and verified them with Simulink model.

•	Precisely controlling the gain for angular position and angular velocity for balancing the robot.
